# Social-Network-API

## <ins>Description</ins>
Social-Network_API utilizes Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose and JavaScript to provide a backend social networking app. This app allows users to post "thoughts" and reactions to those thoughts.  It also allows users to interact and become "friends" or unfriend a user when desired. 

Tested and demonstrated below in Insomnia.
